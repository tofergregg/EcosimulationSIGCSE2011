Traditional introductory programming classes focus on teaching sequential programming
skills using conventional programming languages and single-threaded applications.
Students rarely learn about parallel programming until much later in their careers.
Today, there is a greater need for programmers who are not only proficient in parallel programming,
but who are not burdened by previously learned sequential programming habits, with
parallelism tacked on as an afterthought.

We present an introductory parallel programming course we 
taught to a group of primary school students using a novel parallel programming language.
We provide examples of student-written code and we describe the overall course goal
and specific lesson plans geared towards teaching students how to ``think parallel.''
