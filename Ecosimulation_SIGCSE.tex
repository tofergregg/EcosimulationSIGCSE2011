\begin{abstract}
Traditional introductory programming classes focus on teaching sequential programming
skills using conventional programming languages and single-threaded applications.
It is typical to wait until a student has developed proficiency in sequential programming
before teaching parallel programming and associated topics such as race conditions, locks, and data consistency.  
As computer hardware becomes increasingly parallel, 
there is a greater need for programmers who are proficient in creating parallel programs, 
and not just by ``parallelizing'' their initial sequential designs.

Pedagogically, there is a case to be made that teaching parallelism first is an important 
step towards educating tomorrow's programmers.
We present an overview of a five-day introductory parallel programming course 
we taught to a group of nine and ten year-olds with no prior programming experience. 
We designed our own fundamentally parallel language for the course,
one with a near-natural language syntax that emphasized the roll of individual processors
in executing each statement.
Coupled with an interactive online programming environment, this language allowed us
to teach a wide range of parallel programming concepts in a very limited amount of time.

We provide examples of student-written code that demonstrates their understanding of some basic
parallel programming concepts, and we describe the overall course goal and specific lesson plans
geared towards teaching students how to ``think parallel.''

\section{Introduction}
Introductory programming classes are almost universally taught 
using languages designed primarily for single-threaded applications.  Multi-threaded or
parallel programming concepts are considered advanced, and it is rare that students learn about
parallel programming before a second or third programming course.  Indeed, most colleges and
universities in the United States provide a single parallel programming course available 
to upper level undergraduates or graduate students\FIXME{citestats}; an informal survey
of \FIXME{some number of} schools showed \FIXME{some percentage} had only programming only 
as a senior-level elective, implying the
average programmer would never receive any traditional instruction in parallel programming at all.
Additionally, when students do learn parallel programming, many have difficulties transitioning
from a sequential-programming mentality to a parallel programming mentality, especially as parallel
programming is considered ``hard'' by many students and instructors 
alike.~\cite{parallelExpectations}

Within the last five years, multicore computing has become the \emph{de facto} standard on
desktops and laptops, and General Purpose GPU (GPGPU) computing has matured such that multi-core 
GPUs can be programmed with minimal extensions to traditional languages such as C++ and 
Python~\cite{gpgpuLanguages}.  The trend towards increasing cores to program on a
single machine does not show any signs of abating in the near future~\cite{multicoreTrends}, and
therefore parallel programming skills are going to become increasingly important.  Programmers
must not only thoroughly understand parallel programming concepts such as race conditions,
atomicity, synchronization, and deadlock, but they must be able to look at a computing problem
and think of solutions that utilize parallel processes.
They must also adopt new models of what activities are ``easy'' and ``hard''
in order to develop algorithms and designs that can be efficiently executing by highly-parallel hardware.

We developed an introductory parallel programming course specifically targeting novice programmers.  
Titled ``Programming the Computers of the Future,'' we taught two classes of eighteen 4th and 5th grade 
(9 and 10 year old) students as during a five-day weekend enrichment program.
Each class period was two hours long, and the students had a week between classes, although they
could access the programming development environment online to continue learning independently.
None of the students had significant prior programming experience.

We had three overarching goals in mind for the course:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Introduce the students to basic parallel programming ideas using multiple processors.
\item Help the students develop a mental model of what programming is and what computers do.
\item Teach the students to ``think parallel'' about computing problems.
\end{enumerate}
As a weekend enrichment course, we did not provide structured assessment;
however, we were able to gauge our success through exit surveys, 
informal interactions with individual students, and by looking at the code produced by each student
which was automatically logged by our online programming environment.

The course used a programming language of our own design, called \EcoSim{}\footnote{
\EcoSim{} is so-named because many of the examples we used to guide its design 
focused on an \emph{eco}logical \emph{sim}ulation.} 
which we designed using an English-like syntax that requires limited explanation 
and makes parallelism both pervasive and visible to the user.
We also developed an online environment in which students could write and run code from any computer,
and which gave them step-by-step feedback on the behavior of each emulated processor.
Figure \ref{fig:exampleProgram} shows an example \emph{EcoSim} program that defines and
draws ten green ``plants'' on the screen, where the plants are represented by circles of radius 10.
Figure \ref{fig:ecosimScreencap} shows the \emph{EcoSim} development environment, which includes
a code window, settings, a console window with output messages, and a window for graphical objects.

\section{Background and Related Work}
% Parallelism
Parallel computing is not new, dating back to 1955 and the IBM 704~\cite{hockney1988parallel}.
However, until recently advances in individual processor speed meant single-processor machines
were sufficient for most tasks~\cite{amdahl1967validity}, 
and the bulk of programming practices and pedagogy were developed for a single-processor programming model.
Today, multicore desktop and laptop computers are ubiquitous, and in order to make the most
efficient use of these computers, parallel programming is necessary.  
When novice programmers write their first code today, it is often running on a parallel computer.

There are numerous programming languages available for desktop parallel programming.  Many of
these languages are extensions, libraries, or APIs built on top of sequential languages such 
as C or Fortran 
(e.g., OpenMP, CUDA, OpenCL, Intel Thread Building Blocks, pthreads, Cilk, Co-array Fortran, and Unified Parallel C),
requiring a novice programmer to first become proficient in a sequential language 
before tackling the parallel programming concepts.  
While this does not necessarily hinder a student's overall programming ability, 
parallel programming tends to receive less importance 
than simply learning the sequential aspects of the language.  

There are also languages designed for parallel programming, but they tend have advanced
syntax and be targeted towards
students already proficient at programming in general (e.g., X10\cite{X10}, 
NESL~\cite{nesl-impl-94}, Go~\cite{GoLanguage}, and ParaSail~\cite{ParaSail}).  It would be hard to suggest any of these
languages to an absolute beginner programmer.

% Pedagogy
There have been a number of studies on teaching 
parallel programming concepts using traditional languages at the 
undergraduate level~\cite{freshmanParallel,undergraduateParallel,gridPortal} 
and at least one at the secondary school level~\cite{highSchoolParallel}.
\FIXME{Say something about those four studies, even a sentence}

% Readability
Several successful languages have been designed to have English-like syntax,
including COBOL~\cite{COBOL59}, AppleScript~\cite{AppleScript}, and Wolfram Alpha~\cite{WolframAlpha}.
Like \EcoSim{}, each was designed to accessible to non-programmers
and each targets a relatively narrow set of possible use cases.
None, however, seem suited to teaching parallel programming concepts.

Another approach to making ``readable'' languages 
is to use a graphical rather than textual representation of the program;
two recent example aimed at children are Scratch~\cite{Scratch} and Kodu~\cite{Kodu}.
While there are far more graphical programming languages than we can enumerate
we are unaware of any that can be run without installation, 
read with limited explanation, and are suited to teaching parallel programming concepts.



\section{EcoSim: An Introductory Parallel Programming Language}
In selecting a language for our course we were looking for four characteristics\footnote{
We considered, but rejected, a fifth characteristic: a ``complete'' language.
As an enrichment course, we did not anticipate being a gateway into serious software development.
In hindsight, this may have been a bad choice.
}:
\begin{description}
	\item[Visibly Parallel:]
		We wanted a language that was parallel unless requested otherwise.
		We also wanted the idea of processors processor executing the instructions
		to be emphasized throughout the language and visible in the runtime environment.
	\item[Self-Explanatory:]
		We didn't want to have to translate what code meant.
		No rebinding ``='' to be assignment instead of equality,
		no dependence on concepts past 4th-grade standards,
		and preferably no new symbols or re-defined words at all.
	\item[Web-Based:]
		We wanted the students to be able to work at home without any trouble.
		This meant building on top of either Javascript or Flash, 
		the only tools we could count on all the students having already installed at home.
	\item[Engaging:]
		We wanted every program the students wrote to be interest them.
\end{description}

Since we were aware of no language having all four desired characteristics, 
we created our own.
We designed the syntax and semantics, 
wrote a type-checking parser, interpreter, and runtime environment in Javascript
and created an interaction environment using basic HTML+CSS features 
as well as the HTML5 Canvas element for the graphics.

\subsection{The EcoSim Runtime}\label{sec:runtime}
We determined to structure the \EcoSim{} environment with three basic interfaces:
the code entry pane, 
a status window listing the results of parsing and the behavior of each processor,
and a graphical display of the state of each object.
In the graphical display we decided to place a circle for each object
that had a defined position and size in the student's code
instead of providing some more abstract representation of objects
or an explicit graphics API.

In addition to the user interface, the \EcoSim{} runtime provides the following:
\begin{description}
	\item[A fixed number of virtual processors.]
		At each processing step the interpreter assigns to each processor a task;
		this task is displayed both in the code pane and in the status window.
	\item[A shared work queue for ongoing tasks.]
		Processors pull jobs off this queue in a random order
		and insert any unfinished work back on the queue at the end of each step.
	\item[A global list of objects of each type.]
		Every object that is instantiated is placed on a global list of objects of that type.
		These lists are used to handle ``for each'' and ``for some'' constructs.
	\item[A collision tracker and set of collision handlers.]
		The code may provide handlers for collisions of objects with position and size.
		These are given to the processors if the work queue is empty.
	\item[A set of idle tasks.]
		If the work queue is empty and there are not collisions to handle
		then remaining processors are given jobs from a set of low-priority tasks.
\end{description}

The runtime has awareness of four types:
number (IEEE floating points), color (HTML-compliant color names), 
comparison (boolean values; used only behind the scenes to type-check guard expressions),
and position (a pair of numbers, $x$ and $y$).
User-defined types are built out of these parts.


\subsection{The EcoSim Language}
Three mantras guided our design of \EcoSim{}'s language constructs:
``self-describing syntax'', ``audience: processor'', and ``anonymous by default.''
The first two are direct consequences of our desire to be self-explanatory 
and to have the idea of a processor visible throughout the language.
The last, defaulting to anonymity,
was inspired by the hope that anonymity would keep things parallel 
(if you don't have a name then you are less likely to care which one is present)
but proved far more valuable in that it removed the need 
for students to think up and remember variable names.

Rather than provide a full description of the language that grew out of these mantras,
we provide here a few typical examples
and rely on the language's self-describing character 
to render later code examples understandable.

\subsubsection{Statements}
The first operator we considered was the assignment operator.
We had discovered in earlier interactions with CS1 students
that the syntax used in \texttt{x = x + 1} was often confusing.
We brainstormed ways we might explain that operation,
things like ``$x$ is redefined; it's new value is 1 + the old value of $x$,''
but most were too verbose or failed the ``audience: processor'' mantra.
We finally settled on ``replace x with old x + 1'',
which we implemented as two rules:
an assignment syntax of ``replace \emph{lvalue} with \emph{rvalue}''
and a requirement that the word ``old'' precede rvalue variables that also appear in the lvalue.

Similar processes resulted in 
\texttt{while(1<2)} becoming ``as long as 1 $<$ 2'',
\texttt{else} being replaced with ``otherwise'', 
and \texttt{double x = 3} becoming ``start x as 3''.
We replaced the membership operator (commonly \texttt{.} or \mbox{\texttt{->}})
with the more English-like ``'s'' (as in ``baz's position's x'')
and implemented type inference to create a statically-typed language 
without needing to declare variable types.

The runtime keeps a list of objects of each type (see \S\ref{sec:runtime});
we add to these by writing ``create 3 number'' and and remove with a ``destroy'' command.
We can access objects either by grabbing one randomly selected object:
\begin{snippet}
\STATE for some number
\INDSTATE destroy the number
\end{snippet}
or by accessing all of them in parallel:
\begin{snippet}
\STATE for each number
\INDSTATE replace the number with the old number + 1
\end{snippet}

\subsubsection{Definitions}
We observed that structures, properties, and subroutine definitions
are describing ``what we mean by $X$'' rather than ``you should do $X$''.
We thus decided that, per the ``audience: processor'' mantra, 
we should word these to inform, not direct, the processor.

\begin{snippet}
\STATE a plant has
\INDSTATE size, a number
\INDSTATE a position
\INDSTATE 2 color
\end{snippet}
This introduces a structure type named ``plant''
with a named field ``size'', an anonymous position field, and two anonymous colors.
We can define properties for plants:
\begin{snippet}
\STATE a plant's age is the plant's size - 5
\STATE a plant's trunk is the plant's 2nd color
\end{snippet}
Properties are always single expressions and are accessed exactly like fields.
Multiple fields (such as ``color'' above) can only be accessed by compile-time ordinals;
you cannot write ``the plant's $n$th color'' for variable $n$.

Subroutines are defined with a ``how to'':
\begin{snippet}
\STATE how to add a number years to a plant
\INDSTATE replace the plant's size with the plant's old size + the number
\end{snippet}
Calling a subroutine is straightforward
\begin{snippet}
\STATE for some plant
\INDSTATE add 3 years to the plant
\end{snippet}
It is worth observing that this way of defining and calling subroutines
is context sensitive and not easy to achieve using most parser techniques.
Our parser type-checks and builds the symbol table as it goes,
so when we parse a line ``how to \emph{words}''
we can know which of the words identify types and which are unbound words naming the subroutine.
Similarly, we know from context that ``the plant'' is a value
and thus that we are calling a method named ``add years to'' with two parameters
and not ``add years to the plant'' with only one.

\subsubsection{Handlers}
The last element of the language we want to identify
is collision handlers and idle operations.
\begin{snippet}
\STATE when a bulldozer hits a plant
\INDSTATE destroy the plant
\STATE when bored
\INDSTATE create a plant
\end{snippet}
Again, these are worded to address the processor in a self-explaining way.
They prevent the need for a ``main'' method, since ``when bored'' will suffice,
and make event-oriented programming quite direct.
Multiple ``when bored'' declarations were permitted,
with the runtime selecting between them at random.


\section{Course Overview and Lesson Plans}
The pilot course we created was for fourth and fifth grade students in an enrichment program
that is run through our university.  We designed the course and \emph{EcoSim} concurrently,
and both were targeted for our audience of self-selected primary school students with no
prior formal programming experience.
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item Overview (ecosystem in parallel)
%\item Starting to "think parallel" -- student sort
%\item Ingraining the idea of multiple processors working independently to solve the same problem.
%\item Constantly let kids show off what they have accomplished
%\item the idea of "when bored", for some, for all
%\item atomicity and race conditions (class example on board -- roll/read/roll/write)
%\item St. Matthew Island
%\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Ecosystem in Parallel}
The original conception of the pilot course was, simply, 
``Let's teach fourth and fifth graders about parallel programming.''
Since we knew we had a limited time, we wanted to picked a single theme for all of our programming examples.
The theme we selected was ``ecosystems'', a topic familiar to students at that level
that is inherently parallel, and easy to visualize, 
and allowing a range from very simple forests with stationary plants 
up through complex combinations of different flora and fauna.
By the end of the course students had expanded the ecosystem 
to include plants that only grew during the day and only seeded in their immediate neighborhood,
competing herbivores and hunters, carnivorous and poisonous plants,
as well as more imaginative fantasy elements.

Students quickly learned the importance of initial conditions and parameters, both from a 
computational perspective and a scientific one.  For example, students found that starting 
ten thousand herbivores in a field with only ten plants
not only slows the computer to a crawl, but the herbivores quickly decimate the plant population
and start to die from starvation.  We spent a number of classes discussing and
modeling the intriguing real-life case of a herd of reindeer who overpopulated the remote
St. Matthew Island in Alaska and subsequently died out~\cite{klein1968introduction,stMatthewIsland}, 
and with the \emph{EcoSim} model the students could adjust the parameters to find an
equilibrium that would have allowed the reindeer to survive.

\subsection{Getting the students to ``think parallel''}
We began each class period with a conversation and activity introducing a new parallel programming concept. 
For example, on the first day of class we introduced the students to the difference in
computational time between parallel and sequential processes by having them sort themselves
by height.  First, we allowed the students to line themselves up by height, all at once (the
parallel method), and we timed this; it took roughly forty-five seconds for a class of eighteen.
Next, we re-randomized the class and assigned one student to be the ``processor,'' in charge
of sorting the students two at a time.  Unsurprisingly, this took roughly twice as long, 
leading to a fruitful discussion on why parallel processing can be faster.

\toprule

All students start with a number, and half hand to their neighbor to add together.
This continues until one student has the total sum. & Reduction and Divide/Conquer  \\

\end{tabular}
\caption{Group activities.}
\label{tab:group-activities}
\end{table*} 

Table \ref{tab:group-activities} shows the group activities we conducted and their associated
parallel processing concept or concepts.  During and after each activity, we discussed the
associated concept and in most cases we then wrote a simple program in \emph{EcoSim} that
demonstrated the idea.  Each student sat at a computer with \emph{EcoSim} loaded into their
web browser, and they were able to type out the examples as we wrote them on the overhead 
projector.
For example, after the race condition activity, we wrote the programs in 
Figure~\ref{fig:race-conditions}, which demonstrate a race condition stemming from allowing multiple
processors to complete the \texttt{color} statements in any order.

\emph{EcoSim} allows a programmer to set the number of processors that will be used to run the
program. We used this to demonstrate a number of concepts to the students, including demonstrating
parallel speed-up as well as race conditions.  For example, if \emph{EcoSim} is set to use a single
processor, and the ``In order'' program from Figure~\ref{fig:race-conditions} is amended to remove
line 8, the students can see the individual ``moths'' changing color one at a time.  If we change
the simulator to run with two processors, the students can easily see that two moths change color
at a time, and with 16 processors they can see that all of the moths change all at once and the
program completes almost instantly.  With \emph{EcoSim}'s ability to step through a program, 
individual processor activity can be made even more apparent.

\subsection{The Use of Example Programs}
As with any programming course, example programs played an important role in teaching our course.
This was the first time most of the students had seen any programming language at all, and
therefore we decided to provide a scaffolding in the form of example programs that they could
look at and modify.  \emph{EcoSim} has a ``Load Example'' button that brings up a listing of
example programs that the instructors can update at any time.  Many times during class we would
have students pay attention to the projector as we typed in the code for a program, and then we
would have them load the example instead of typing it out.  This saved time (not all pre-teens
are fast typists), and it also allowed us to start the whole class at the same point in a program's
development.  In some cases we gave them example programs that were missing a line or two and
asked them to fill in the details themselves.  We encouraged the students to modify the programs
as well, and students that completed assignments before others in the class were able to modify
the example programs or load other programs they had been working on previously.

Another reason we relied on example programs was to build a compendium of programs that the students
could go back and look at if they did not remember the details of a particular topic.  Frequently,
we would direct the students to previously covered examples, and we would also keep versions of 
certain programs so they could see the steps used to create more robust programs.

\subsection{Student Assessment}
Because this was an ungraded enrichment class, we did not perform formal assessments (e.g., tests
or deadline based homework); however, we reviewed the students' work regularly and gave feedback
often.  At the beginning of each hour of class, we asked whether anyone had something they wanted
to show the class, and we displayed their work on the projector and let them describe and run the
programs.  This motivated the students to create interesting programs, and the students enjoyed
showing off their work to the rest of the class.  Some students showed off work that they completed
on their own at home during the week between classes, which we highly encouraged.

All student work is captured in a MySQL database that we were able to review regularly.  Each time
a student clicks on the ``Setup Code" (which parses the code and reports errors), the current
program is saved, and all versions are retained.  Therefore, we were able to look at a students 
progress, including how many attempts they made at fixing syntax errors, and how they went about
building their programs.  We used this analysis to determine where we needed to review; e.g.,
once we realized how much trouble the students had with understanding indentation and blocks, we
modified our lesson plan to include a review and further examples.

\section{Student Work and Outcomes}
During the course, the students had an opportunity to modify example programs that the whole
class had access to, and they also were able to write their own applications.  Because we 
had access to all modifications of each student's code, we were able to perform some
statistical analysis on their code, including determining how many different applications 
students worked on, and how long it took them to fix certain coding errors.  On average, 
each student worked on twenty different programs, with a minimum of twelve and a maximum
of thirty-two.  Students that worked on more programs tended to be the ones who picked up
the material the fastest, and also worked on their own at home.  The students' programs ranged 
from five-line examples to a 150-line program that 
was the culmination of the St. Matthew Island deer/plant ecosystem simulation, and some students
created novel programs that demonstrated proficient understanding of the language.  
Figure~\ref{fig:pacmanProgram} shows part of one student's ``Pacman'' program, demonstrating that
he understands the parallel nature of the language and has applied it correctly.

On the last day of class, the students had the opportunity to show off their work to their
parents and siblings. Our instruction to them on the last day was to prepare a program that
they either created on their own, or an example from class that they modified significantly.
They enthusiastically demonstrated their programs, which ranged from modifications to the St.
Matthew Island ecosystem that led to a deer equilibrium, to programs that had snow ``fall'' on
the screen and accumulate at the bottom, to a simulation that included mice searching for cheese.

\section{Conclusions}
We have demonstrated that it is possible to teach elementary school students parallel programming,
even if they are completely novice programmers.  We designed a unique, natural language-based parallel 
programming language that used a single-window, web-based interface to streamline teaching and
student learning, and we provided a curriculum that taught the students basic parallel programming
ideas, including race conditions, atomicity, and the speedups that can be obtained by using
multiple processors.  The students eagerly learned the language, with few conceptual difficulties
and demonstrable success.  Parallel programming does not have to be difficult to teach or learn,
and it is a skill that will become even more important as computers continue to become more
parallel in the future.
