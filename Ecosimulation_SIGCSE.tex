\begin{abstract}
Traditional introductory programming classes focus on teaching sequential programming
skills using conventional programming languages and single-threaded applications.
It isn't generally until much later in a student's programming education that he or she learns
about parallel programming and associated topics such as race conditions, locks, or data
consistency.  With the increased popularity of 
multicore CPUs and GPUs capable of GPGPU computing, there is a greater 
need for programmers who are not only proficient in parallel programming, but who are
not burdened by an inclination towards trying to solve a problem in a sequential fashion, with
parallelism tacked on as an afterthought.

Pedagogically, there is a case to be made that teaching parallelism first is an important 
step towards educating tomorrow's programmers for the challenges of programming multicore and GPGPU
systems.  We present an overview of a five-day introductory parallel programming course we 
taught to a group of nine and ten year-olds, using a near-natural language syntax
parallel programming language we created, targeted towards students with no previous programming
experience.  Our language is simple but powerful and consists 
of a simulated parallel programming environment and the ability to run or step through programs.

We provide examples of student-written code that demonstrates their understanding of some basic
parallel programming concepts, and we describe the overall course goal and specific lesson plans
geared towards teaching students how to ``think parallel.''

\section{Introduction}
Introductory programming classes are almost universally taught 
using languages designed primarily for single-threaded applications.  Multi-threaded or
parallel programming concepts are considered advanced, and it is rare that students learn about
parallel programming before a second or third programming course.  Indeed, most colleges and
universities in the United States provide a single parallel programming course available 
to upper level undergraduates or graduate students\FIXME{citestats}, and such courses are
almost always optional in the computer science curriculum.  In many cases, only students who
are interested in high performance computing are ever exposed to parallel programming, and the
average programmer never receives any traditional instruction in parallel programming at all.
Additionally, when students do learn parallel programming, many have difficulties transitioning
from a sequential-programming mentality to a parallel programming mentality, especially as parallel
programming is considered ``hard'' by many students and instructors 
alike.~\cite{parallelExpectations}

Within the last five years, multicore computing has become the \emph{de facto} standard on
desktops and laptops, and General Purpose GPU (GPGPU) computing has matured such that multi-core 
GPUs can be programmed with minimal extensions to traditional languages such as C++ and 
Python~\cite{gpgpuLanguages}.  The trend towards increasing cores to program on a
single machine does not show any signs of abating in the near future~\cite{multicoreTrends}, and
therefore parallel programming skills are going to become increasingly important.  Programmers
must not only thoroughly understand parallel programming concepts such as race conditions,
atomicity, synchronization, and deadlock, but they must be able to look at a computing problem
and think of solutions that utilize parallel processes.

With the disconnect between sequential-only introductory programming classes and the necessity for
programming students to learn parallel programming concepts and methods in mind, we developed
an introductory parallel programming course that specifically targeted novice programmers.  We
designed a language, called \emph{EcoSim}\footnote{\emph{EcoSim} is so-named because the original 
class we taught with it focused on an \emph{eco}logical \emph{sim}ulation.}\FIXME{Are we going to 
name the language officially?}, that simulates a parallel programming environment and has a highly
accessible natural language syntax.  Programs written in \emph{EcoSim} have the ability to exhibit race 
conditions, allow both atomic and non-atomic variable assignment, and show increased performance
when the number of cores is increased.  It is a turing-complete language, and
contains a number of basic functions geared towards making the programs interesting for novice
programmers.  Figure \ref{fig:exampleProgram} shows an example \emph{EcoSim} program that defines and
draws ten green ``plants'' on the screen, where the plants are represented by circles of radius 10.
Figure \ref{fig:ecosimScreencap} shows the \emph{EcoSim} development environment, which includes
a code window, settings, a console window with output messages, and a window for graphical
objects.

main window shows the graphical output of the program.}
\label{fig:ecosimScreencap}
\end{figure}

We had three overarching goals in mind for the course we designed around \emph{EcoSim}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Introduce the students to simple parallel programming ideas using multiple processors.
\item Provide interesting parallel programming examples the students could easily modify and
learn from.
\item Teach the students to ``think parallel'' about computing problems we gave them, or that
they thought up on their own.
\FIXME{should we include the define the task/describe a solution/tell the computer here?}
\end{enumerate}

We presented the course, titled, ``Programming the Computers of the Future'' to two classes of 
eighteen 4th and 5th grade (9 and 10 year old) students during a five-day enrichment program.
Each class period was two hours long, and the students had a week between classes, although they
could access the programming development environment online to continue learning independently.
None of the students had significant prior programming experience.
We based the course curriculum on creating a simulated ecosystem, starting with simple objects
such as stationary plants that could grow in place, and eventually creating herbivores and
carnivores that could move about the screen.
Our lessons included group exercises that introduced parallel programming concepts and general
programming-style problem solving, and each lesson included example \emph{EcoSim} programs with
time for the students to modify or attempt to create new programs on their own.

We had many successes in our pilot course:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Exit surveys collected from the students in both classes showed enthusiastic responses to the
class, and students reported that they learned a number of programming concepts.
\item Student code examples show that by the end of the class students were familiar with the
language and were able to write programs that took advantage of parallel concepts.
\item After one or two classes the students
felt comfortable with basic concepts of \emph{EcoSim} and were able to write rudimentary
parallel programs without trouble.  By the end of the course, a number of students designed
and implemented creative programs that highlighted the parallel nature of the language.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Background and Related Work}

Parallel computing has a long history, dating back to 1955 and the IBM 704
and its ability to compute parallel arithmetic~\cite{hockney1988parallel}.  Amdahl's law,
defining the maximum possible speedup due to parallelization, was coined in 
1967~\cite{amdahl1967validity}, and multiprocessor mainframes and multinode distributed
computing platforms provided most of the world's parallel processing until the early 2000s.
However, even with multiprocessor systems, programmers were first taught how to write
sequential applications, generally learning parallel programming concepts for specific
computers or platforms.  The microcomputer explosion of the late 70s and early 80s
ensured that most programmers were exposed to uniprocessor machines as their first computers,
and thus their first programming experiences were with sequential programming languages as well.
Today, multicore desktop and laptop computers are ubiquitous, and in order to make the most
efficient use of these computers, parallel programming is necessary.  Furthermore, when novice
programmers sit down to write their first code, it is using a a parallel computer.

There are numerous programming languages available for desktop parallel programming.  Many of
these languages are extensions, libraries, or APIs built on top of sequential languages such 
as C or Fortran (e.g., OpenMP, CUDA, 
OpenCL, Intel Thread Building Blocks, pthreads, Cilk,
Co-array Fortran, and Unified Parallel C),
requiring a novice programmer to first become proficient in a sequential language before
tackling the parallel programming concepts.  While this does not necessarily hinder a student's
overall programming ability, parallel programming tends to receive less importance than simply
learning the sequential aspects of the language.  There have been a number of studies on teaching 
parallel programming concepts using traditional languages at the 
undergraduate level~\cite{freshmanParallel,undergraduateParallel,gridPortal} 
and at least one at the secondary school level~\cite{highSchoolParallel}.

There are also languages designed for parallel programming, but they tend have advanced
syntax and be targeted towards
students already proficient at programming in general (e.g., X10\cite{X10}, 
NESL~\cite{nesl-impl-94}, and Go~\cite{GoLanguage})\FIXME{Should we site ParaSail, CUDA, Cilk, \dots?}.  It would be hard to suggest any of these
languages to an absolute beginner programmer.

Several successful languages have been designed to have English-like syntax,
including COBOL~\cite{COBOL59}, AppleScript~\cite{AppleScript}, and Wolfram Alpha~\cite{WolframAlpha}.
Like \EcoSim{}, each was designed to accessible to non-programmers
and each targets a relatively narrow set of possible use cases.
None, however, seem suited to teaching parallel programming concepts.

Another approach to making ``readable'' languages 
is to use a graphical rather than textual representation of the program.
Recent successful examples aimed at children include Scratch~\cite{Scratch} and Kodu~\cite{Kodu}.
We do not pretend to be aware of all graphical programming environments
but were unaware of any that could be run without installation
and used to teaching parallel programming concepts.


\section{\EcoSim{}: An Introductory Parallel Programming Language}
To teach programming, it is necessary to select a language or environment.
We had four characteristics we wanted in the language we taught:
\begin{description}
	\item[Fundamentally Parallel:]
		We wanted a language that was parallel unless requested otherwise.
		We also wanted the idea of a processor executing the instructions
		to be visible throughout the language.
	\item[Self-Explanatory:]
		We didn't want to have to translate what code meant.
		No rebinding ``='' to be assignment instead of equality
		and preferably no new symbols or re-defined words at all.
	\item[Web-Based:]
		We wanted the students to be able to work at home without any trouble.
		This meant using either Javascript or Flash, 
		the only zero-installation tools we could count on \emph{all} the students having.
	\item[Engaging and Transparent:]
		We wanted every program the students wrote to be interesting to them, which meant no text outputs.
		We also wanted a ``glass hood'' so they could watch the parallel engine running.
\end{description}
Notably absent from these goals is being a ``complete'' language.
Our objective was to teach parallel programming concepts,
not necessarily to provide a gateway into serious software development.

Since we were aware of no language having all four desired characteristics, 
we created our own.
We designed the syntax and semantics, 
wrote a type-checking parser, interpreter, and runtime environment in pure Javascript
and created an interaction environment using basic HTML+CSS features 
and the new HTML5 Canvas element for the graphics.

\subsection{The \EcoSim{} Runtime}\label{sec:runtime}
We determined to structure the \EcoSim{} environment with three basic interfaces:
the code entry pane and two visualizations of the program being executed:
a status window to listed the behavior of each processor
and a graphical display of each object.
In the graphical display we decided to automatically draw a circle for each object
for which the students' code had defined a position and a size
rather than providing some more abstract representation of objects
or an explicit graphics API.

In addition to the interfaces, the \EcoSim{} runtime provides the following:
\begin{description}
	\item[A fixed number of virtual processors.]
		Each processing step the interpreter assigns each processor a task
		and displays the work performed by the processor 
		in both the code pane and in the status window.
	\item[A shared work queue for ongoing operations.]
		Processors pull jobs off this queue in a random order
		and insert any unfinished work back on the queue at the end of each step.
	\item[A global list of objects of each type.]
		Every object that is instantiated is placed on a global list of objects of that type.
		These lists are used to handle ``for each'' and ``for some'' constructs.
	\item[A collision tracker and set of collision handlers.]
		The code may provide handlers for collisions of objects with position and size.
		These are given to the processors if the work queue is empty.
	\item[A set of idle tasks.]
		If the work queue is empty and there are not collisions to handle
		then remaining processors are given jobs from a set of low-priority tasks.
\end{description}
To facilitate these operations
we provided a built-in notion of only four types:
number (IEEE floating points), color (HTML-compliant color names), 
comparison (boolean values; used only behind the scenes to type-check guard expressions),
and position (a pair of numbers, $x$ and $y$).
User-defined types are built out of these parts.


\subsection{The \EcoSim{} Language}
Three mantras guided our design of \EcoSim{}'s language constructs:
``self-describing syntax'', ``audience: processor'', and ``anonymous by default.''
The first two are direct consequences of our desire to be self-explanatory 
and to have the idea of a processor visible throughout the language.
The last, defaulting to anonymity,
was inspired by the hope that anonymity would keep things parallel 
(if you don't have a name then you are less likely to care which one is present)
but proved far more valuable in that it removed the need 
to spend time trying to think of variable names.

Rather than provide a full description of the language that grew out of these mantras
we provide here a few typical examples
and rely on the language's self-describing character 
to render later code examples understandable.

The first operator we considered was the assignment operator.
We had found through interactions in CS1 courses
that the syntax used in \texttt{x = x + 1} caused confusion in many students.
We brainstormed ways we might explain that operation,
things like ``$x$ is redefined; it's new value is 1 + the old value of $x$''
but that is too verbose and fails the ``audience: processor'' mantra.
We finally settled on ``replace x with old x + 1'':
assignments as ``replace \emph{lvalue} with \emph{rvalue}''
and the word ``old'' required for variables in the rvalue that also show up in the lvalue.

A few more examples of this sort:
\texttt{while(1<2)} becomes ``as long as 1 $<$ 2'',
\texttt{else} becomes ``otherwise'',
\texttt{double x = 3} becomes ``start x as 3''.
We replaced the membership operator (commonly \texttt{.} or \texttt{->})
with the more English-like ``'s'' as in ``baz's position's x''
and use type inference to have a statically-typed language 
without needing to declare variable types.

The runtime keeps a list of objects of each type (see \S\ref{sec:runtime}).
We add to these by writing ``create 3 number'' or 
\begin{snippet}
\STATE create 4 number and for each 
\INDSTATE replace the number with 7
\end{snippet}
We can access just one randomly selected object, or all of them in parallel:
\begin{snippet}
\STATE for some number
\INDSTATE destroy the number
\STATE for each number
\INDSTATE replace the number with the old number + 1
\end{snippet}

Structures, properties, and subroutine definitions
are describing ``what we mean by $X$''
rather than ``you should do $X$'';
utilizing the ``audience: processor'' mantra, these are worded 
to inform, not direct, the processor.
\begin{snippet}
\STATE a plant has
\INDSTATE size, a number
\INDSTATE a position
\INDSTATE 2 color
\end{snippet}
This introduces a structure type named ``plant''
with a named field ``size'', an anonymous position field, and two anonymous colors.
We can define properties for plants:
\begin{snippet}
\STATE a plant's age is the plant's size - 5
\STATE a plant's trunk is the plant's 2nd color
\end{snippet}
Properties are always single expressions and are accessed exactly like fields.
Multiple fields (such as color above) can only be accessed by compile-time ordinals;
you cannot write ``the plant's $n$th color'' for variable $n$.

Subroutines are defined with a ``how to'':
\begin{snippet}
\STATE how to add a number years to a plant
\INDSTATE replace the plant's size with the plant's old size + the number
\end{snippet}
Calling a subroutine is straighforward
\begin{snippet}
\STATE for some plant
\INDSTATE add 3 years to the plant
\end{snippet}
It is worth observing that this way of defining and calling subroutines
is context sensitive and hence not readily doable with most parser techniques.
Our parser type-checks and builds the symbol table in the same pass as it parses,
so when we parse a line ``how to \emph{words}''
we can identify which of the words are identifying types
and which ones are naming the subroutine.
Similarly, we know from context that ``the plant'' is a value
and thus that we are calling a method named ``add years to'' with two parameters
and not ``add years to the plant'' with only one.

The last element of the language we want to identify
is collision handlers and idle operations.
\begin{snippet}
\STATE when a bulldozer hits a plant
\INDSTATE destroy the plant
\STATE when bored
\INDSTATE create a plant
\end{snippet}
Again, these are worded to address the processor in a self-explaining way.
They prevent the need for a ``main'' method, since ``when bored'' will suffice,
and make event-oriented programming quite direct.
Multiple ``when bored'' declarations were permitted,
with the runtime selecting between them at random.


\section{Course Overview and Lesson Plans}
The pilot course we created was for fourth and fifth grade students in an enrichment program
that is run through our university.  We designed the course and \emph{EcoSim} concurrently,
and both were targeted for our audience of self-selected primary school students with no
prior formal programming experience.
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item Overview (ecosystem in parallel)
%\item Starting to "think parallel" -- student sort
%\item Ingraining the idea of multiple processors working independently to solve the same problem.
%\item Constantly let kids show off what they have accomplished
%\item the idea of "when bored", for some, for all
%\item atomicity and race conditions (class example on board -- roll/read/roll/write)
%\item St. Matthew Island
%\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Ecosystem in Parallel}
The original conception of the pilot course was, simply, ``Let's teach fourth and fifth graders
about parallel programming.''  We decided on an ``ecosystem'' theme for the course, based on a
number of reasons.  First, students at this level are familiar with real-life ecosystems, and we
felt that they would find the topic interesting.  Second, ecosystems have a number of 
embarrassingly parallel characteristics; for example, in a forest there are multiple copies
of trees which can each be handled independently and in parallel.  
Finally, we knew we could model a simple ecosystem 
and then build upon the original model to make it more complex.  Starting with a forest of
stationary plants that have a single ``grow'' characteristic, we added motile herbivores that
consumed the plants.  We then added the ability for the inhabitants to reproduce and gave them
the ability to die from starvation, and then eventually we added carnivores as well.  
By the end of the course students had expanded the ecosystem to include plants that only
grew during the day, hunters, and even carnivorous and poisonous plants.  

Students quickly learned the importance of initial conditions and parameters, both from a 
computational perspective and a scientific one.  For example, students found that starting 
ten thousand herbivores in a field with only ten plants
not only slows the computer to a crawl, but the herbivores quickly decimate the plant population
and start to die from starvation.  We spent a number of classes discussing and
modeling the intriguing real-life case of a herd of reindeer who overpopulated a remote
island in Alaska and subsequently died out~\cite{klein1968introduction,stMatthewIsland}, 
and with the \emph{EcoSim} model the students could adjust the parameters to find an
equilibrium that would have allowed the reindeer to survive.

\subsection{Getting the students to ``think parallel''}
At the beginning of each class period and before writing any code, we first introduced the 
students to a parallel programming concept in a full-class discussion, usually with an activity.
For instance, on the first day of class we introduced the students to the difference in
computational time between parallel and sequential processes by having them sort themselves
by height.  First, we allowed the students to line themselves up by height, all at once (the
parallel method), and we timed this; it took roughly forty-five seconds for a class of eighteen.
Next, we re-randomized the class and assigned one student to be the ``processor,'' in charge
of sorting the students two at a time.  Unsurprisingly, this took over three minutes, and this
led to a fruitful discussion on why parallel processing can be faster.

Table \ref{tab:group-activities} shows the group activities we conducted an their associated
parallel processing concept or concepts.  During and after each activity, we discussed the
associated concept and in most cases we then wrote a simple program in \emph{EcoSim} that
demonstrated the idea.  Each student sat at a computer with \emph{EcoSim} loaded into their
web browser, and they were able to type out the examples as we wrote them on the overhead 
projector.
For example, after the race condition activity, we wrote the programs in 
Figure~\ref{fig:race-conditions}, which demonstrate a race condition stemming from allowing multiple
processors to complete the \texttt{color} statements in any order.

the final color is dependent on a race condition.}

\emph{EcoSim} allows a programmer to set the number of processors that will be used to run the
program. We used this to demonstrate a number of concepts to the students, including demonstrating
parallel speed-up as well as race conditions.  For example, if \emph{EcoSim} is set to use a single
processor, and the ``In order'' program from Figure~\ref{fig:race-conditions} is amended to remove
line 8, the students can see the individual ``moths'' changing color one at a time.  If we change
the simulator to run with two processors, the students can easily see that two moths change color
at a time, and with 16 processors they can see that all of the moths change all at once and the
program completes almost instantly.  With \emph{EcoSim}'s ability to step through a program, 
individual processor activity can be made even more apparent.

\subsection{The Use of Example Programs}
As with any programming course, example programs played an important role in teaching our course.
This was the first time most of the students had seen any programming language at all, and
therefore we decided to provide a scaffolding in the form of example programs that they could
look at and modify.  \emph{EcoSim} has a ``Load Example'' button that brings up a listing of
example programs that the instructors can update at any time.  Many times during class we would
have students pay attention to the projector as we typed in the code for a program, and then we
would have them load the example instead of typing it out.  This saved time (not all pre-teens
are fast typists), and it also allowed us to start the whole class at the same point in a program's
development.  In some cases we gave them example programs that were missing a line or two and
asked them to fill in the details themselves.  We encouraged the students to modify the programs
as well, and students that completed assignments before others in the class were able to modify
the example programs or load other programs they had been working on previously.

Another reason we relied on example programs was to build a compendium of programs that the students
could go back and look at if they did not remember the details of a particular topic.  Frequently,
we would direct the students to previously covered examples, and we would also keep versions of 
certain programs so they could see the steps used to create more robust programs.

\subsection{Student Assessment}
Because this was an ungraded enrichment class, we did not perform formal assessments (e.g., tests
or deadline based homework), however we reviewed the students' work regularly and gave feedback
often.  At the beginning of each hour of class, we asked whether anyone had something they wanted
to show the class, and we displayed their work on the projector and let them describe and run the
programs.  This motivated the students to create interesting programs, and the students enjoyed
showing off their work to the rest of the class.  Some students showed off work that they completed
on their own at home during the week between classes, which we highly encouraged.

All student work is captured in a MySQL database that we were able to review regularly.  Each time
a student clicks on the ``Setup Code" (which parses the code and reports errors), the current
program is saved, and all versions are retained.  Therefore, we were able to look at a students 
progress, including how many attempts they made at fixing syntax errors, and how they went about
building their programs.  We used this analysis to determine where we needed to review; e.g.,
once we realized how much trouble the students had with understanding indentation and blocks, we
modified our lesson plan to include a review and further examples.
