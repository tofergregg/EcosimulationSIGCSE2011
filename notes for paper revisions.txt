Comments for updating SIGCSE:

1. Why 9/10 year olds? -- (Chris will address)

2. General concepts in parallel computing is not the problem; the devil is in the details. (Section 4.2 -- put in something about race conditions; something that they experienced that was different than what they might have expected). Change "impact of having" to "speedups resulting from"  

3. Race condition wasn't clear that we care about the outcome. (find example where it matters--wrong color) --> Black circles showed up when one processor created/colored/grew an object and a separate processor found an object and grew it.  This caused race conditions and caused us to add an "atomically" keyword while teaching the class. (Chris will address 2 and 3 together in section 4.2). 

4. Alice, Mindstorm, Greenfoot, etc. (Luther will add)

5. Scattergun.  Leaps around.

6. Not much interaction except for collision.  -- could have added "when <predicate>" for any number of different behaviors. (Luther)
